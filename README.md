Backup for my static site self-hosted on a Raspberry-pi at http://www.r3m1.com

Feel free to use it as model if you want to host your own Pelican website, but the primary goal of this repo is 
mainly for backup purpose, and also to be able to edit this site from github, which is pretty neat if you
ask me...
